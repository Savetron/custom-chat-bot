// This file previously contained server actions related to chat management,
// such as generating titles, deleting messages, and updating visibility.
// Since database and authentication features have been removed,
// these actions are no longer needed and have been removed.

// If new server-side actions specific to the simplified chatbot are required,
// they can be added here.
